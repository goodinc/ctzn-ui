        <h6>Help us count the number bicyclists and pedestrians as they commute on September 16th and 19th.</h6>
        <p>The city of Los Angeles is working to become more bike and pedestrian friendly, but LADOT currently only measures the number of motor vehicles that pass through intersections.   They do not currently count pedestrians, cyclists, or other road users.   This lack of data makes it difficult to determine where infrastructure is needed and where it needs improvement.   The Los Angeles County Bike Coalition and Los Angeles Walks are teaming up again to count people on bikes and people walking at key locations throughout the city and provide that data to LADOT on September 16th and 19th.   I'm going to be counting at Santa Monica Blvd. near Glendon Ave on the 16th.   I hope some of you will join me in helping improve the safety and mobility for everyone in Los Angeles!

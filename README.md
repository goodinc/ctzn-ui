* Make the app look good in modern browsers on any size screen.

* Make the app accessible for users with diverse input devices, like touchscreens and screen readers.

* Use simple, consistent HTML patterns to make integration with templates easy.

* Use simple, consistent CSS patterns so rules and selectors can be reused.

            <h1>Curator Tips</h1>

            <p>While CTZN’s true success comes in helping to foster a collaborative community where individuals can connect and share in a collective Push, group administrators, or Curators, have a few bonus powers that will help them maintain structure.</p>
            <p>Here is an overview of what Curators can do.</p>

            <h2>Invite People via Email</h2>

            <img class="screenshot" src="../assets/images/curator/invite-people.jpg" alt="Screenshot" />

            <p>As a Curator, you can invite your community into your Push with a press of a button. Simply press “Invite More People via Email” and CTZN will automatically connect to your email client (works extra well on mobile). Add in as many email addresses as you’d like and press send. CTZN will send everyone an invite email that contains a direct link into your Push.</p>

            <h2>Promote People to Curators</h2>

            <img class="screenshot" src="../assets/images/curator/promote-curator.jpg" alt="Screenshot" />

            <p>Share the power of curator with your organization’s most trusted members–or take it away, instantly and without the support of a CTZN team member.</p>

            <h2>Hide Posts</h2>

            <img class="screenshot" src="../assets/images/curator/hide-posts.jpg" alt="Screenshot" />

            <p>While we encourage everyone to share a wide range of content on CTZN ranging from “This is how I want to change LA” to “Look at our office’s pet chickens!”, we understand that not all content fits our Push’s purpose. As Curator, you have the option of Hiding posts from the feed by pressing on the “...” button at the bottom of a post and pressing “Hide”. This will make the post invisible to everyone but the original poster and those users who have already interacted with the post. This will also prevent the post from appearing in the Morning Digest.</p>

            <h2>Curate the Live Channel</h2>

            <img class="screenshot" src="../assets/images/curator/curate.jpg" alt="Screenshot" />

            <p>A Curator, however, is ultimately responsible for Curating the Push’s best content. Next to the “Love” and “Comment” buttons, Curator’s have an additional Star Button which allows them to Feature posts. When a post is Featured, it becomes publicly viewable on your Push’s public site. From this public site, featured content can be made into a Live Slideshow that can be updated automatically and broadcast on your website (through a widget) and on monitors and projectors.</p>

The information below outlines what information is collected (yes, we do collect some), how we may use that information (we may use some of it), the persons to whom the personal information may be disclosed, and the security measures taken to protect the personal information.</p>

            <p><i>Last Updated on February 11, 2015.</i></p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for ctznapp.com, getctzn.com, and the CTZN app on the iOS and Android platforms (collectively referred to as “CTZN”). If you have questions or concerns about any aspect of this policy, please feel free to contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator as follows:</p>

            <p>Privacy Policy Coordinator (CTZN)<br />GOOD Worldwide Inc<br />6380 Wilshire Blvd<br />15th Floor<br />Los Angeles, CA 90048</p>

            <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. You can access the Privacy Policy anytime at www.getctzn.com/privacy. Your use and/or registration on any aspect of CTZN will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy. This privacy policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline and on sites linked to from CTZN.</p>

            <h2>1. What this Policy Covers.</h2>

            <p>This policy covers our treatment of information that we obtain when you visit CTZN. This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners or advertisers. In addition we may provide links to other services and on occasion links to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites own independently of CTZN and they have their own privacy and security practices. For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their privacy policies before submitting personal information to them.</p>

            <h2>2. Information CTZN Gathers.</h2>

            <p>Information CTZN gathers generally falls into two categories: (1) personally identifiable information, which is gathered with your specific knowledge and consent, for instance when you complete a survey, or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your email address, and name, and (2) non-personally identifiable information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected as you navigate use of CTZN.</p>

            <h3>2.1. Personally Identifiable Information That You Give&nbsp;Us.</h3>

            <h4>2.1.1. Registration.</h4>

            <p>Registration for CTZN requires that you supply certain personally identifiable information including, in most cases, a unique email address and demographic information to register.</p>

            <h4>2.1.2. Connection through CTZN to Third Party Services.</h4>

            <p>You may choose to connect a Third Party Service (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) to CTZN . By doing this, you are granting us permission to bring the content stored by that service into CTZN (including profile information and content you created on that platform that uses the hashtags specified on CTZN) . We treat that information as we do any other information you give us when you log-on, register, create posts, write comments or create a profile.</p>

            <h4>2.1.3. User Generated Content and Activities (including Comments and Facebook and Twitter sharing).</h4>

            <p>We offer you opportunities to engage in activities on CTZN. “Activities” are any actions you take on CTZN that are designed to be visible to other users on CTZN, including posts, comments, mixes and participation in pushes. Any information you disclose in your Public Activities, including your screen name, any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by CTZN for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you chose to engage in Public Activities, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to submit there can be read, collected, and used by other readers of these areas, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums and CTZN has no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any Public Activities. Certain Activities may be designated as public  ("Public Activities") by the owner of a push.</p>

            <p>If you have signed up for a CTZN account, we will track and aggregate your Public Activities on CTZN. If you choose to participate in Activities, you are electing to share and display such Activities on CTZN. Also, Public Activities may be included in RSS feeds, APIs, and made available to other websites in other formats. As a result your Public Activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds.</p>

            <h4>2.1.4. Surveys, Panels, and Market Research.</h4>

            <p>CTZN may collect personal information from you from third party applications (ex: Google Analytics) and/or in connection with voluntary surveys. Unless we notify you at the time of collection, the information you provide may be shared, but only in aggregate, with advertisers and partners.</p>

            <h3>2.2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected Using Technology.</h3>

            <h4>2.2.1. Device Information.</h4>

            <p>We may collect information about the computer, mobile telephone, smart phone, or other device you use to access CTZN.</p>

            <h4>2.2.2. Cookies and Web Beacons.</h4>

            <p>We use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. You will not be able to access certain areas of CTZN, if your computer does not accept cookies from us.</p>

            <h4>2.2.3. Analytics Technologies.</h4>

            <p>We have hired third parties to provide us information, reports and analysis about the usage and browsing patterns of the users of GOOD. The non-personally identifiable information is collected to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, and gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole. We do not tie this data to personally identifiable information.</p>

            <h4>2.2.4. Log Files and Reading History.</h4>

            <p>We automatically log certain information about your use of CTZN. This information includes reading history of the pages you view. We may use this information to provide you with customized recommendations based on your reading history. We also use log files in aggregate usage of CTZN.</p>

            <h2>3. How GOOD Uses the Information We Gather.</h2>

            <h3>3.1. Services You Request.</h3>

            <p>CTZN uses personally identifying information you supply to provide you with the service you have requested.</p>

            <p>We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products, or services and/or to improve the services we offer by tailoring them to your needs. Similarly, if you enter an online contest, sweepstakes, or giveaway, we will use the information you provide to notify you.</p>

            <h3>3.2. Analysis.</h3>

            <p>We perform statistical, demographic, and marketing analysis of users of GOOD for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our users. We also use this information to improve customer relationships.</p>

            <h3>3.3. Third Party Service Providers.</h3>

            <p>GOOD will allow access to our database by third parties that provide services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, shipping, email distribution, list processing, and analytics or promotions management. Our service providers are restricted from using any data in any way other than to provide services for GOOD and they may not share or resell our data.</p>

            <h2>4. Our Email Policy.</h2>
            <p>GOOD complies fully with the federal CAN SPAM Act of 2003.</p>

            <h3>4.1. Account Related Emails.</h3>

            <h2>5. Kids and Parents.</h2>

            <p>CTZN is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, forums, and chats. Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 must get the permission of their parent(s) or legal guardian (s) before making purchases, including subscriptions on the site. If you are worried about you're your children's activities or their privacy on our site, we encourage you to contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described above.</p>

            <h2>6. Legal Stuff.</h2>

            <h3>6.1. Legal Requirements.</h3>

            <p>We may also provide access to our databases to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings, including, for example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal proceedings.</p>

            <p>As our business changes, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event that all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by GOOD, its parent, subsidiaries, or affiliates, are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, the information from and/or about CTZN users may be among the assets.</p>

            <h2>7. How Information is Kept Secure.</h2>

            <h3>7.1. Security of Account Information.</h3>

            <p>Your member account information is password-protected. We will not share your password with anyone. Please do not share your password with anyone, and remember to change your password from time to time, to keep your account information secure.</p>

            <h3>7.2. Network Security.</h3>

            <p>We have implemented a variety of commercially standard encryption and security technologies and procedures to protect information, including your personal information, stored in our computer systems from unauthorized access.

            <h3>7.3. Management Procedures.</h3>

            <p>We also maintain standard physical and electronic procedural safeguards that limit access to your personally identifiable information to our employees (or people working on our behalf and under confidentiality agreements) who, through the course of standard business activities, need to access your personally identifiable information.</p>

            <p>These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by GOOD without restriction.
            Entire Agreement. The Terms of Service, including GOOD's Copyright Policy and Privacy Policy which are hereby incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and GOOD and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and GOOD.</p>

            <h3>Governing Laws.</h3>
            <p>The Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

            <h3>Dispute Resolution.</h3>
            <p>Except as provided herein, no civil action with respect to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service may be commenced until the matter has been submitted to JAMS for mediation. The parties agree that any such mediation shall take place in Los Angeles County, California, USA. Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties covenant that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator and any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may seek equitable relief prior to the mediation to preserve the status quo pending the completion of that process. Except for such an action to obtain equitable relief, neither party may commence a civil action with respect to the matters submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial mediation session, or 45 days after the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. Mediation may continue after the commencement of a civil action, if the parties so desire. The provisions of this section may be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys' fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.</p>

            <h3>Waiver and Severability.</h3>
            <p>The failure of GOOD to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties to this Agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>

            <h3>Notices.</h3>
            <p>GOOD may provide you with notices, including, without limitation, those regarding changes to the Terms of Service and other service-related announcements, by email and/or by postings on the Service (for example, by posting to the blog, or on the relevant page(s) of the Service affected by such changes).</p>

            <h3>Trademarks.</h3>
            <p>GOOD, the GOOD logo, and other GOOD logos and names are trademarks of GOOD. You agree not to display or use these trademarks in any manner without GOOD's prior, written consent.</p>

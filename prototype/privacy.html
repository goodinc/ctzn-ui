          <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. You can access the Privacy Policy anytime at community.good.is/about/privacy. Your use and/or registration on any aspect of GOOD will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy. This privacy policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline and on sites linked to from GOOD.</p>

          <p>1. What this Policy Covers. This policy covers our treatment of information that we obtain when you visit GOOD. This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners or advertisers. In addition we may provide links to other services and on occasion links to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites own independently of GOOD and they have their own privacy and security practices. For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their privacy policies before submitting personal information to them.</p>

          <p>2. Information GOOD Gathers. Information GOOD gathers generally falls into two categories: (1) personally identifiable information, which is gathered with your specific knowledge and consent, for instance when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our publication(s), or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your email address, name, and phone number, and (2) non-personally identifiable information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected as you navigate use of GOOD.</p>

          <h2>2.1. Personally Identifiable Information That You Give Us</h2>

Registration for GOOD requires that you supply certain personally identifiable information including, in most cases, a unique email address and demographic information to register.

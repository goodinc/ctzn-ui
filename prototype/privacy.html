            <p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for ctznapp.com, getctzn.com, and the CTZN app on the iOS and Android platforms (collectively referred to as “CTZN”). If you have questions or concerns about any aspect of this policy, please feel free to contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator as follows:</p>

            <p>Privacy Policy Coordinator (CTZN)<br />GOOD Worldwide Inc<br />6380 Wilshire Blvd<br />15th Floor<br />Los Angeles, CA 90048</p>

            <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. You can access the Privacy Policy anytime at www.getctzn.com/privacy. Your use and/or registration on any aspect of CTZN will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy. This privacy policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline and on sites linked to from CTZN.</p>

            <h2>1. What this Policy Covers.</h2>

            <p>This policy covers our treatment of information that we obtain when you visit CTZN. This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners or advertisers. In addition we may provide links to other services and on occasion links to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites own independently of CTZN and they have their own privacy and security practices. For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their privacy policies before submitting personal information to them.</p>

            <h2>2. Information CTZN Gathers.</h2>

            <p>Information CTZN gathers generally falls into two categories: (1) personally identifiable information, which is gathered with your specific knowledge and consent, for instance when you complete a survey, or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your email address, and name, and (2) non-personally identifiable information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected as you navigate use of CTZN.</p>

            <h3>2.1. Personally Identifiable Information That You Give Us</h3>

            <h4>2.1.1. Registration.</h4>

            <p>Registration for CTZN requires that you supply certain personally identifiable information including, in most cases, a unique email address and demographic information to register.</p>

            <h4>2.1.2. Connection through CTZN to Third Party Services.</h4>

            <p>You may choose to connect a Third Party Service (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) to CTZN . By doing this, you are granting us permission to bring the content stored by that service into CTZN (including profile information and content you created on that platform that uses the hashtags specified on CTZN) . We treat that information as we do any other information you give us when you log-on, register, create posts, write comments or create a profile.</p>

            <h4>2.1.3. User Generated Content and Activities (including Comments and Facebook and Twitter sharing).</h4>

            <p>We offer you opportunities to engage in activities on CTZN. “Activities” are any actions you take on CTZN that are designed to be visible to other users on CTZN, including posts, comments, mixes and participation in pushes. Any information you disclose in your Public Activities, including your screen name, any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by CTZN for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you chose to engage in Public Activities, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to submit there can be read, collected, and used by other readers of these areas, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums and CTZN has no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any Public Activities. Certain Activities may be designated as public  ("Public Activities") by the owner of a push.</p>

            <p>If you have signed up for a CTZN account, we will track and aggregate your Public Activities on CTZN. If you choose to participate in Activities, you are electing to share and display such Activities on CTZN. Also, Public Activities may be included in RSS feeds, APIs, and made available to other websites in other formats. As a result your Public Activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds.</p>

            <h4>2.1.4. Surveys, Panels, and Market Research.</h4>

            <p>CTZN may collect personal information from you from third party applications (ex: Google Analytics) and/or in connection with voluntary surveys. Unless we notify you at the time of collection, the information you provide may be shared, but only in aggregate, with advertisers and partners.</p>

            <h4>2.2.2. Cookies and Web Beacons.</h4>

            <p>We use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there.

            <p>We automatically log certain information about your use of CTZN. This information includes reading history of the pages you view.

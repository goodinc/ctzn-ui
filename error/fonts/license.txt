You and any third party web font hosting service are responsible for ensuring that the font software in the self-hosting kit, in its original format, can only be used on the Web Sites for which the self-hosting kit was downloaded and cannot be used or referenced by any other web site. This includes, but is not limited to installing adequate technical protection measures that restrict the use and/or access to the font software, for instance by utilizing JavaScript or access control mechanism for cross-origin resource sharing and protecting against use on web sites other than the Web Sites for which the self-hosting kit was downloaded by restricting domain access only to such Web Sites. You must also retain the pageview tracking code on any Web Site that you self-host. In the event this Agreement terminates for any reason, the font software included with the self-hosting kit must be deleted from the server and all copies must be destroyed or returned to Monotype Imaging.
